This is a nixos configuration repository. It is personalized for me. Most of the configuration
describes how my machine is set up. Whenever we make changes here, make sure to understand
the consequences of the changes to the operating system.

An example is, when you remove a package from the systemPackages, make sure to explicitly
note that in your summary at the end, that package will no longer be installed.

You can use the
```
nixos-rebuild -I zsedem-config=(realpath (status dirname)/..) dry-activate
```
oneliner to test our changes.
The expected output for a successful run is
> Failed to start transient service unit: Interactive authentication required.
> Error: switch-to-configuration must be run as the root user
> warning: error(s) occurred while switching to the new configuration

Because we don't run the command with root priviliges we get this output and it is fine.

NEVER offer to run the command with root priviliges. (meaning: do not offer to run commands with `sudo`)

Offer to make a git commit after we did a meaningful change. Include the whole message, like this:
```
git commit -am "<message>"
```
where your `<message>` should be a meaningful description of the change.
